# User Flow

## Welcome Page

The first page that users will encounter is a welcome page featuring the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Users must agree to these terms and confirm that they are of legal age before being redirected to the `Humanode OAuth 2 Service`.

## OAuth 2 Flow

In `Humanode OAuth 2 Service` flow, users are required to validate by showing their face to the camera. After validation and agreeing to share their `Humanode Identifier` with `Humanode Biomapper`, they will be redirected back to `Humanode Biomapper`, with their identifier stored in a hashed form known as `Biotoken`.

## Signing Page

The signing page allows the user to submit the transaction. The chosen EVM address and the stored `Biotoken` are sent to the `Signing Server` to obtain the signature. Following this, the user calls the `proveUniqueness` function with the `Biotoken` and the obtained signature, resulting in an on-chain record of the user's uniqueness.
