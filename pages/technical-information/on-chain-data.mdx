# On-chain Data

## Overview

### Current Uniqueness State

The uniqueness of an address in a given moment of time is represented via a simple predicate in the `Biomapper` contract.

```solidity
function isUnique(address queriedAddress) external view returns (bool);
```

See more info at [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

### Generations Historical Data

The notion of a generation is captured in the form of an element of a doubly linked list inside a `BiomapperLog` smart contract.

```solidity
struct Generation {
    bytes32 generation;
    uint256 prevPtr;
    uint256 nextPtr;
}

function generationsHead() external view returns (uint256);

function generationsTail() external view returns (uint256);

function generationsListItem(
    uint256 ptr
) external view returns (Generation memory);
```

Each generation is uniquely identified by the block number in which the generation change occurs. This block number is called the generation `ptr`.

`generationsListItem` function returns `Generation` struct for provided generation `prt`.

`generationsHead` and `generationsTail` functions return generation `ptr` of the current and oldest generation, respectively.

`prevPtr` and `nextPtr` fields of some `Generation` struct are the generation `ptr` of previous and the next generations, respectively. If there is no previous or next generation, these fields are zero.

`generation` field of `Generation` struct is a salted hash of some deployment data. Usage of this field is discouraged. This field is **DEPRECATED**.
